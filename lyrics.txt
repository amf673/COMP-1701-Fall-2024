The Happiest Days of our Lives	Roger Waters

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town, it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
                   
Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 	Roger Waters

	We don't need no education
	We dont need no thought control
	No dark sarcasm in the classroom
	Teachers leave them kids alone
	Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
	All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
	All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, Do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!"
